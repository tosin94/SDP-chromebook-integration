- Test what kind of http response when attempting to import an already imported workstation
- 

## TODO
- Create a model in SDP called "NO MODEL" for machines that may not have a model set in SDP
- investigate tf002928, it seems to have some keys missing. e.g, model, platformVersion....
- write tool in such a way that it carries on if a device fails to upload but brings attention to IT support with details of the error. log asset ID and details or error
    - if log can be html edited or structured, will be nice
