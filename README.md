# Introduction 
This Project integrates Google admin with service desk plus via API calls.
The idea is to pull chromebook data from google admin and import it into the assets module in service desk.  

- Access to google is read-only (should be)  
- API documentation:
    -   [servicedesk plus ](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/sdpod-v3-api/)  
    -   [other](https://ui.servicedeskplus.com/APIDocs3/index.html)
- API credentials created at - [api-console](https://api-console.zoho.uk/)
(user should be an account with **access to SDP** and has admin rights)  

API Scopes in use:
-   SDPOnDemand.assets.CREATE
-   SDPOnDemand.assets.READ
-   SDPOnDemand.setup.CREATE
-   SDPOnDemand.setup.READ
-   SDPOnDemand.users.READ
-   SDPOnDemand.users.CREATE
-   SDPOnDemand.users.UPDATE


***NOTE*** - Code needs to be moved to main repo
