# Introduction 
This Project integrates Google admin with service desk plus via API calls.
The idea is to pull chromebook data from google admin and import it into the assets module in service desk.  

- Access to google is read-only (should be)  
- API documentation - [servicedesk plus ](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/sdpod-v3-api/)  
- API details created at - [api-console](https://api-console.zoho.uk/)
(user is the **manage-engine admin account** as it has access to both SDP and EPC)  

Scopes in use:
-   SDPOnDemand.assets.CREATE
-   SDPOnDemand.assets.READ
-   SDPOnDemand.setup.CREATE
-   SDPOnDemand.setup.READ
-   SDPOnDemand.users.READ
-   SDPOnDemand.users.CREATE



# Getting Started
<!--TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references
5.  Gcloud cli setup (how its been used in the subcriber workflow)


# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.
